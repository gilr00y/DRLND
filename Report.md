### Learning Algorithm

### Tuning

To achieve the performance described below, certain hyperparameters for the algorithm had to be tuned to find a satisfactory result.

These hyperparameters are described as follows:



### Architecture

### Performance

### Future Improvements

#### Double DQN

For the double-DQN algorithm, only a few changes are necessary. A prototype implementation of this is present in a Jupyter Notebook in the project directory labeled `Navigation-DoubleDQN.ipynb`.

#### Dueling DQN



#### Prioritized Experience Replay
